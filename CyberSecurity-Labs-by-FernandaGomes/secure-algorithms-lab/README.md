## Objective

Develop detection and response algorithms that identify suspicious patterns and automate security analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Flask (API demonstration)  
- Regular expressions

## Description

This lab focuses on constructing robust scripts to detect anomalies in log files and network data. It includes designing a simple API using Flask to expose detection capabilities. The project emphasizes structured thinking for secure software and demonstrates how algorithm design underpins cyber defense.

## Results

Examples include a script that flags repeated failed login attempts and an API endpoint that returns detection results for uploaded logs.

## Future Work

- Extend to real‑time alerting mechanisms.  
- Incorporate more sophisticated pattern recognition techniques.
