## Objective

Configure and harden essential network services such as DNS and DHCP to build secure and resilient infrastructures.

## Tools & Technologies

- Packet Tracer  
- Linux server environments  
- Shell scripting

## Description

In this lab a simulated network topology is designed using Packet Tracer. It demonstrates secure configuration of DNS and DHCP services, including proper zone configuration, access control, and monitoring. The objective is to understand typical misconfigurations and implement mitigations to reduce attack surfaces.

## Results

Deliverables include topology diagrams, configuration files, and scripts that automate service deployment and validation.

## Future Work

- Expand to multi‑site networks with redundant services.  
- Integrate intrusion detection sensors for comprehensive monitoring.
