## 🧠 Objective
Design and implement secure relational and cloud-based database models that enforce confidentiality, integrity and availability through encryption, role-based access control and auditing.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL
- Firestore / Firebase
- ERD design tools (draw.io, Lucidchart)
- Python (psycopg2, SQLAlchemy)

## 🧳 Description
This lab applies data modeling principles to cybersecurity by building robust database schemas with security controls embedded. It includes designing entity–relationship diagrams (ERDs), implementing tables with constraints, triggers for auditing, and encryption at rest/in transit. The demonstration extends to a cloud database using Firebase, highlighting differences between SQL and NoSQL security.

## 🚀 Results
The repository provides schema definitions, migration scripts and example queries. It also includes a security checklist and a sample audit log illustrating how access attempts are recorded and monitored.

## 📈 Future Work
Enhance the lab by integrating role-based access control (RBAC), column-level encryption for sensitive fields, and automated compliance checks. Extend to multi-tenant architectures and secret management integration.
