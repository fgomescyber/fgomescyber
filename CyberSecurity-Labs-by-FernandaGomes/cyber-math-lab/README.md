## Objective

Apply mathematical concepts to calculate metrics such as password entropy and risk probabilities, supporting quantitative cyber risk analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- NumPy, SciPy  
- Statistical methods

## Description

This lab demonstrates how fundamental mathematics underlies cybersecurity analytics. It covers computation of entropy for password strength evaluation and basic probability models for estimating the likelihood of breaches. Through Python scripts, it provides practical examples of using numerical methods to make informed security decisions.

## Results

The project includes scripts that compute entropy for sample passwords and functions that calculate risk scores based on historical incident data.

## Future Work

- Expand into cryptographic number theory.  
- Build Monte Carlo simulations for complex risk scenarios.
