## Objective

Apply statistical and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and anomalies in cyber attack data.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, SciPy  
- Matplotlib

## Description

This lab explores how to process and analyze security event logs to extract meaningful insights. Using Python libraries, it demonstrates how to import logs, clean the data, and build visualizations that highlight trends in intrusion attempts and system performance. The goal is to inform proactive defense strategies through data‑driven intelligence.

## Results

Sample outputs include histograms of login attempts per hour and scatter plots showing correlations between IP addresses and response times.

## Future Work

- Integrate machine learning models to classify anomalies.  
- Automate log ingestion and analysis pipelines.
